# SSTEM-Learn-Github-and-Python 

We're going to put all of your calculators from the last lab into this project. 

You'll need to clone this project to the Raspberry Pi or your own machine. You can do this by running the command: 
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/scottshuffler/SSTEM-Learn-Github-and-Python.git
```

Enter the directory and modify the main.py file by adding your code into the class with your name on it. 

Once you've tested your code we're going to commit your code and then push it back to Github. 
``` bash
git commit -a -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
git push origin master
```
